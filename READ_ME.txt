Objective:
1. This program checks if a given binary relation R on a given set S is transitive or not. 
2. It further computes the transituve closure of the relation and prints the closure. 

Usage:

Query:  

"check_transitive(set, relation)."

        set: form of a list. eg. [a,b,c,d],
        relation: form of a relation. eg. [(a,b), (c,d), (d,a)].


Output: 

"Transitive closure:" Prints the transitive closure of the relation R on the set S.
"Is transitive?" : true - if R is transitive
                   false - if R is not transitive
